# Welcome | FÃ¡ilte

Vancouver School of Irish Music is a non-profit society with the goal of bringing authentic Irish traditional music to young people in Vancouver. Check out our blog below for a flavour of our activities!

We are currently enrolling for our Fall term classes (ages 7-12, multiple classes).
Classes will be held on Tuesday evenings, 6-7 pm at Renfrew Elementary School during the elementary school term from September to Christmas.

New students will begin with the tin whistle (supplied by us) and returning students will have the opportunity to take up other instruments (fiddle, flute, accordion, etc). 

Please email us at [info@vsim.ca](mailto:info@vsim.ca) to register your child.
