Vancouver School of Irish Music is a non-profit organization which aims to foster a community of traditional Irish musicians and enthusiasts here in Vancouver, BC.

Our [current series of classes](classes.md) is running from April - June 2025, for children aged 6-12.

If you are interested in joining us next term in September 2025 please [get in touch!]({% link contact.md %})

As the school grows we plan to introduce adult classes as well as host concerts and further [masterclasses from visiting musicians](_posts/2025-02-06-sean-gavin-lecture.md).
