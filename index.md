Vancouver School of Irish Music is a non-profit organization which aims to foster a community of traditional Irish musicians and enthusiasts here in Vancouver, BC.
Our [first series of classes](classes.md) is due to begin in January 2025, for children aged 7-10. 
As the school grows we plan to introduce adult classes as well as host concerts and masterclasses from visiting musicians.
