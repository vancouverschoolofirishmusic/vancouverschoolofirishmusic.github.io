Vancouver School of Irish Music was founded in April 2024.
We are a non-profit organization which aims to foster a community of traditional Irish musicians and enthusiasts here in Vancouver, BC. 
We plan to hold classes for children and adults as well as host concerts and masterclasses from visiting musicians. 

Browse our website (still a work in progress) for further information. You can email us at the address below, or subscribe to our email newsletter on our [Contact]({% link contact.md %}) page.
