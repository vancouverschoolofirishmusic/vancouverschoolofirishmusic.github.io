## Programmes
A short series of classes is planned for September 2024 as a pilot programme, and we hope to run a broader programme of ensemble and instrument classes in early 2025. Please get in touch to register your interest!

## Location
We are actively searching for an appropriate venue in East Vancouver, to be reasonably accessible from Vancouver, North Vancouver, New Westminster and Coquitlam.
