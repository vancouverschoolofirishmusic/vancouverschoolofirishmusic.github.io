## Fall Term 2025

Our Fall term classes will run on Tuesday evenings from September 2nd to Dec 18th, from 6-7 pm at [Renfrew Elementary](https://maps.app.goo.gl/in528fYvUAeSQCtCA), for children aged 6-12 years.

New students will begin with the tin whistle (provided by VSIM), but we can offer lessons in other instruments to returning students.

Please email us at [info@vsim.ca](mailto:info@vsim.ca) to register!
