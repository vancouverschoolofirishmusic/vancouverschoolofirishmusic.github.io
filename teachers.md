Eoin is a concertina and flute player from Dublin, Ireland who has been living in Vancouver for the past 5 years. Eoin has been playing Irish traditional music since as early as he could talk, and has had the pleasure of being taught over the years by some of Ireland's greatest proponents of the music: the O'Connor family, Micheal O'Raghallaigh, Noel Hill, Harry Bradley, and Paul McGrattan. Eoin has countless regional and All-Ireland Fleadh medals to his name, and was a full-time gigging musician and music teacher in Dublin for many years, before moving to Vancouver and returning to his accountancy career.
